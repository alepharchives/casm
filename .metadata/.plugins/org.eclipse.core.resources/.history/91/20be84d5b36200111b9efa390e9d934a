 *
 * In this project i created a small scale DSL (domain specific language) that lets us
 * easily describe interactive commands within our domain (namely matrix manipulation).
 *
 * parser.c and parser.h contains the code that parses a given line of user input.
 * it is heavily influenced by parser combinators. Since C cannot use lambda
 * expressions, the implementation is not really functional in style. more details on
 * the technique i used is found in these files.
 *
 * matdsl.c and matdsl.h contains the definitions of all dsl's directives and commands.
 * these were designed to be as composable as possible under the restriction of the C language.
 * To achieve that i had to slightly abuse the #define keyword. again, further details
 * are given in these files. (the real magic happens in matdsl.c!)
 *
 * main.c file contains the simple logic for our program - read one line at a time,
 * and try out all of our commands on that line. if all fails, an error is printed.
